        <h2>About Perf-hier (Performane Hierarchy).</h2>
        <p>
          Consider recording page load times (the onload event) for all your
          users and tracking it across time. Gathering aggregate stats. Breaking
          the stats based on browser etc. This app (perf-hier) helps you do that without
          setting up your own back-end servers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Comparison with related solution might make the offering more
          clear. <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/overview.html">Google
          Page Speed</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a>
          analyzes page performance characteristics and reports
          improvements. This site is about the measurement and tracking of page
          performance. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jiffy-web/">Jiffy-web</a>
          provides tools to setup measurement at front-end, record the logs and
          analyze the logs. But the servers have to be setup, the database
          configured
          etc. <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/06/performance_testing_with_boomerang/">Boomerang</a>
          also provides a front-end tool to register various events, and send a
          beacon to back-end and is in some ways better than Jiffy. But again,
          the back-end has to be brought up and maintained. Much like the
          approach taken by Google Analytics, Perf-hier provides a solution
          where the developer would include small javascript in the page, and
          rest all is taken care of, by the app.
        </p>

        <p> In few words, the app provides <b>page speed analytics</b>. </p>

        <p> By the way, this is not the complete truth. For more information try
          the <a href="/#url=/about/details">details</a> page.
        </p>

        <p>
          tl;dr:
          <a id="demolink" class="button" href="javascript:;">Try the demo</a>
          On clicking you should see 'stats for testproj' on the left side
          navigation. Explore it to know the kind of stats available. Its the
           performance stats for this site.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/login">Login</a> using your Gmail account. Create a <a href="/#url=/proj/new">new
          project</a>. And include the javascript provided, in your
          website. Later, u can see the stats
          by <a href="/#url=/proj/select">selecting</a> the project.
        </p>

        <p>If your site has more than 1 req/sec, <a href="#url=/about/details">contact me</a> and I will setup a
        separate server for your site. I cant go beyond free quota of Google
        App Engine. </p>

    </script>

    <script id="about_stats" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl">
      <h2>Stats and presentation</h2>
      <h3>Whats logged ? </h3>
      <p>
        If default script snippets is used, it logs 3-4 events. First, when the
        javascript snippet, to be included at the top of file, is
        executed. Second, when the bottom snippet is executed. Third, when the dom
        load event happens. And fourth, if a cookie was saved when last page
        unload happened. The hierarchy measurements are defined as follows.
      </p>
      <ol class="pure-list">
        <li>whole: The whole request. if unload event was logged, it also is
        included in the measure.</li>
        <li>whole/req: Time between the last unload and current page start.</li>
        <li>whole/page: From page start to page load.</li>
        <li>whole/page/body: From page start to page end.</li>
      </ol>
      </br>
      <p>
        You could have custom hierarchies. The beacon sent to server is quite
        simple. So you could write your own javascript to send beacons to
        perf-hier server. For convenience, a script is also provided (proj/src
        in the nav). It helps log the data in hierarchical way.
      </p>

      <h3>How are the stats presented ?</h3>
      <p>
        The aggregate of the measured hierarchy is presented in a hierarchical
        ring form. Its inspired by the GNU Linux tool
        called <a href="http://www.marzocca.net/linux/baobab/">Disk Usage
        Analyzer</a>. Its made with <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">RaphaÃ«l Javascript
        Library</a>. Clicking on any ring, brings the respective ring in center
        and only shows its hierarchy. Clicking at the center bring the structure
        to its original configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also a graph shows the timeline for all the tags. Graph is created with
        <a href="http://danvk.org/dygraphs/">Dygraphs</a>. It allows zooming
        into time range.
      </p>

        </p>

        <h3>how</h3>
        <p>The app allows gathering statistics for any hierarchical data. It
        keeps track of aggregate and timeline of the stats. One could find
        various use for it, apart from page performance analytics.</p>
        <p> This app is implemented
          on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App
          Engine</a>. Google App Engine provides unique opportunity. It allows
          reasonable free usage. Its designed with scalability in mind. But it
          puts limits on various operations. This app is built across those
          limits. It tries to use the free quota efficiently. It records the
          beacons sent from client side, without much processing. In about a
          second, it gather the received requests. And updates a common
          datastructure (to overcome the 1 write per sec(approx) limit). These
          are maintained on hourly basis. A cron job further updates the main
          datastructure with these updates on hourly basis. The result is
          available/accessible via APIs. Haven't implemented authentication for
          the API, so currently only the in-page javascript, based on the login
          cookie, is allowed to access the API. Well, if you r interested, let
          me know. I will provide you with more details.
          </br>
          By the way, did you notice, the site has no images. Except the fevicon.
        </p>


        <h3>what now?</h3>
        <p>This project is in beta (may be even alpha)
          stage. Catch the bugs and let me know.
          <!-- i shall try to squash them. --> There are many possibilities for
          the app. I will try to implement then one by one.

          Some examples:
          <ul class="pure-list">
            <li><b>Live update of graphs:</b> Graphs show the data, about an hour
            late. That too with manual refresh. Some time, i will get to
            implementing live auto updates of graphs. </li>
            <li><b>Dimensions:</b> At the moment only browser dimension is
            supported. There is scope for adding dimension like user geolocation
            (IP or browser provided). May be even user net connection bandwidth
            and latency, ex: as provided
            by <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/boomerang">Boomerang</a> </li>
            <li><b>Better stats:</b> The outliers might effect the average
            count. The characteristics for cached site might be different than
            uncached once. Similarly there are many improvements that could be
            added to the stats. </li>
            <li><b>Front-end:</b> The front-end is basically written in
            javascript. It uses API to interact/get data from back-end. I have
            skipped the caching altogether, in this version of app. Also, the
            front-end is not quite stable yet. Again lots to do.</li>
            <li><b>WebTiming API:</b> could
            use <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebTiming/">WebTiming
            API</a> to gather stats (atleast for the browsers which have
            implemented it.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <!-- <p>also talk about the presentation. explain the hierarchical ring -->
        <!-- graph. also the timelines. and that u should not change tags, as they -->
        <!-- will screw the aggregate. probably just delete the old one. or may be -->
        <!-- in future, have a new reference point for calculating the aggregate for -->
